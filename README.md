Simulation calculator for the game Elemental Kingdoms by Arcannis.

Requirements
-----------------

Python 3.3+

Install
-----------------

I have not yet packaged this project and registered it with PyPI - although I plan to in the future.  For now you'll need to clone the project and run the simulation manually.::

    $ git clone git@github.com:ricomoss/ek-calc.git
    
Or you can create your own fork to make code changes yourself.  If you plan to contribute to the project please fork and submit pull requests from a branch on your fork to the dev branch of this project.


Releases and Branches
-----------------

The master branch is meant for release.  Upon an update to the master branch the version will increment according to the format: (major).(minor).(micro)

The dev branch holds all approved updates to the project until a release milestone is met, at which time dev will be merged into master.

Development is done on branches from dev and merge via pull requests into dev. Everyone is encouraged to fork this repo and create pull requests with additions they would like to see in the project.
